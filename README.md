**🌳 Decision Tree Classifier**
A classification project that demonstrates how Decision Trees can be used to predict categorical outcomes based on input features.

📁 Dataset
Used a labeled dataset for binary/multi-class classification (e.g., Iris).
Includes both numerical and categorical features relevant to the prediction task.

🔧 Preprocessing
Handled missing values and cleaned the dataset
Encoded categorical variables where needed
Split the dataset into training and testing sets
Visualized feature relationships using basic plots

🧠 Model
Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier from scikit-learn.
Trained the model on the training set and predicted on the test set.
Visualized the structure of the decision tree for interpretability.

📊 Evaluation
Accuracy score

🚀 Future Enhancements
Compare with other tree-based models (XGBoost)
Create an interactive web UI to visualize predictions in real time
